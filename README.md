# aoc2017
my solutions to the advent of code 2017 problems. most of them'll probably be completely unreadable for no good reason. written in rust. 

~~yes, i'm hardcoding the inputs into my code.~~  
okay, about that...
rust apparently has a really useful 
`include_str!(filename)`
macro that easily allows you to turn a file's contents into a string (thanks, u/aurele!) so i'll be using that instead.
